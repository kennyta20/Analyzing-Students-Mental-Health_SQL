# Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health_SQL
This project explores the relationship between the length of stay of international students and their mental health diagnostic scores. Using data from a Japanese international university’s 2018 survey, we analyze key psychological metrics—PHQ-9 (depression), SCS (social connectedness), and ASISS (acculturative stress)—to identify potential correlations. By aggregating and comparing scores across different lengths of stay, we aim to understand how the adaptation process impacts mental well-being. The findings will provide insights into whether longer stays contribute to better mental health outcomes or heightened stress among international students.
